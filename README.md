# My Portfolio

Welcome everyone to the Online Curriculum Vitae project offered by Digital Innovation One.

The project aims to assemble our first web page that will be a replica of an Online CV, using html concepts and Github Pages. At the end we will have our curriculum ready and available in a static way.

It can also be used as a curriculum vitae and personal portfolio.

This is my personal portfolio showcasing my skills, experiences, and projects. It provides an overview of my background as a FullStack Developer and highlights my expertise in various technologies.
